Step 1: Get pyinstaller

pip install pyinstaller


Step 2: Install all referenced modules

pip install [modulename]

NOTE: If you forget or aren't sure all the modules you need, you can continue these steps and then go to /build/warn-.........txt and scroll through any modules that are considered missing. (top-level) are the main ones to pay attention to.

Step 3: Make the exe

Step 3.1: Navigate to the directory in command prompt (cmd.exe)

cd ./Documents/Github/.......
You can check if you're there by typing 
dir
in command prompt and if you see your file, you're ready to continue.

Step 3.2: Actually making the exe 
pyinstaller -F --hidden-import "babel.numbers" [filename].py

babel.numbers is just really annoying and this was the only fix I could find online. Seems to work fine though :)
